# curriculum-databases-projects-template

 This template should be used for database related projects at Microverse.
 Generate your own repository, update this README and edit all files content while working on projects. You should not be adding any new files unless asked otherwise.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database

- Use [schema.sql](.schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](.data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](.queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
